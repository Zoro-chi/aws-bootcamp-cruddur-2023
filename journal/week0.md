## Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

##HOMEWORK
  
 1) I set up my Billing alarm by linking it to an AWS budget. I also added my email for email notifications on updates.

2) I set up a Budget by creating an access policy for my IAM User groups for my Users to inherit.

3) I set up an AWS IAM User by creating one with my root account. I also change my Account ID to an alias to remember easily. 

4) I accessed the cloudshell through the console with the icon in the top right menu corner.

5) LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE
